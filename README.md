# Areas Of Contribution

This *public* repo contains the set of skills, organized by "area" and "P-level", that CF Engineering management in SF and LA use when gathering feedback and evaluating engineers.

Have questions about how to interpret all of this?  Ask your manager, or open an issue on this repo!

## Motivation

We intend for the skills listed in this repo to describe the *impact* that a Pivot has.  We're trying to not focus too much on specific activities.

This is because we want to avoid perverse incentives or "gamifiying" the performance of activities to the detriment of outcomes.  Also, there is often more than one activity, or way of doing an activity, that can lead to a particular outcome.  So we want to align our standards with positive outcomes for our teams, our customers, and our company.

For more background on the thinking behind our current feedback process, [watch this video](https://sites.google.com/a/pivotal.io/cloud-foundry/resources/events-recordings/tech-talks/tt_feedback).

## How to interpret "frequency" & "impact"

**Frequecy** & **impact** are similar to [outputs & outcomes](https://hbr.org/2012/11/its-not-just-semantics-managing-outcomes). **Frequency** is important, it describes the consistency of a pivot's efforts. **Impact** is related and perhaps more important, it speaks to whether these efforts were effective.

### FREQUENCY

- Have you observed a pivot do this? 
  - Don't check anything unless you have
  - When you observed this: 
    - Did it required prompting? Check "Only when asked"
    - Is consistent & unprompted? Check "Appropriately"
    - Have they sometimes needed prompting? Check "Occassionaly"
    - Is it more nuanced? Use a combination of these boxes

### IMPACT

- What difference have they made?
  - Leave **impact** blank and use **frequency** only if it isn't clear or if they haven't yet made a difference
  - Did it improve something? Check "High"
  - Did something get worse? Check "Low"
  - Is there room to make more of a difference than it did? Check both boxes.
  - Please ensure managers have enough context; via the space in the form or shared directly with them
