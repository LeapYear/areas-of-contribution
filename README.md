# Areas of Contribution

Initial content of this repo came from the open-source https://github.com/pivotal-cf/areas-of-contribution

## Where to start

The general recommendation is to focus feedback and review with these 3 areas of contribution:

1. [collaboration](collaboration.md)
1. [engineering process](engineering-process.md)
1. [technical execution](technical-execution.md)

..potentially swapping one out for another at the request of the engineer, through discussion with their manager.
