# Areas of Contribution

Initial content of this repo came from the open-source https://github.com/pivotal-cf/areas-of-contribution

## Where to start

The general recommendation is to focus feedback and review with these 3 areas of contribution:

1. collaboration
1. engineering process
1. technical execution

..potentially swapping one out for another at the request of the engineer, through discussion with their manager.
