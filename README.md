## How to interpret "impact" and "frequency"
- **IMPACT: High**: When Pivot does this line item, they do it well. Roughly this maps to meeting expectations and above.

- **IMPACT: Low**: When Pivot does this line item, they could do it better.  Roughly this maps to not meeting expectations and below.  When marking this, please provide additional context (there's space on the form, or share directly with the Pivot's manager).

- **FREQUENCY**: This helps with the “when” from above. This is about *consistency* and *taking initiative*.

All boxes are optional.  Use them any any combination:

- Example 1: If the Pivot is having a “neutral” or "unknown" impact for a skill, then leave "impact" blank and use frequency axis only.

- Example 2: If a line item isn't applicable for any reason, then leave the entire line item blank.

- Example 3: If a Pivot often meets expectations, but still has some room to grow, then check *both* "IMPACT: high" *and* "IMPACT: low".
