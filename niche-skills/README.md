## Niche Skills
A `niche skill` is useful to formally recognize an employee for their impact in an area that isn't comprehensively outlined in the central skill areas. This skill may be optional, subject-matter-specific, interest-specific, emerging in its practice within the organization, or requires better definition to be evaluated. The niche skill framework invites individuals to express their unique impact and interests, and allows leadership to recognize their contributions. 

In order to use this category, the engineer, manager, and director must agree upon a career ladder or set of skills relevant to the new skill area. Once the skill area has been created, the individual invests effort in developing those skills and using them to make a positive impact in the organization. 

### Design notes
Please include a short blurb, explaining the overarching purpose of this skill area, and an example of an individual practicing it.  Depending on the topic, mapping the niche skill area to p-levels may make sense, but isn't required. At minimum, start with a bulleted list of skills in (approximate) ascending order of difficulty. Please refer to the [contributor's guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#style-guide) for guidance on writing skill descriptions.

### Example: Subject matter expertise in Networking

You are on a team that has gone through two back-to-back rewrites. The team hasn't been able to ship and deliver on customer outcomes in over a year. You notice that the previous attempts to solve the customer problem didn't work because no one on the team has deep domain expertise on container-to-container networking. Additionally, you notice that there are other parts of the organization that could benefit from having thought leadership in this space. 

Your manager, director, and you talk through what it could mean for you to develop expertise in Networking as it relates to Distributed Systems. All three of you collaboratively build a career ladder of value you could bring to the organization by developing this expertise at a beginner level all the way up to a L6 (top level) level. You embark on the journey to add 'Subject Matter Expertise in Networking' as a Niche Skill to your Skills Matrix, and commit to stay on the journey to improve your expertise in Networking for the foreseeable future. You work hard to improve these skills, and are able to demo / teach your team, improving their decision-making abilities. Your ability to provide resources and advise the team is an ongoing support, as you continue to develop your Networking knowledge and skills.
