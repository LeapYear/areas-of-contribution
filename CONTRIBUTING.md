# Contributing

**This repo is a work in progress.**

This effort is still early and we've got a lot of problems to solve.  We welcome questions and suggestions for improvement.

Feel free to open GitHub issues with questions or concerns. You can also reach out to your local Engineering Director to learn more, and/or join the conversation on Pivotal Slack at `#feedback-collection`.

## Roadmap
We're actively working to lower the cost of change to this repo.  Our goal is to
enable a pull-request workflow.

To get there, we plan to:

1. Document underlying intent behind existing skills: so that Pivots can consider and incorporate that intent when proposing changes to this repo

2. Establish a change-review process: so that contributors understand how
  their proposed changes will be reviewed and merged.

3. Establish a deployment process: so that changes here are reflected in the
  forms we use when gathering feedback.  [Related issue here](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/areas-of-contribution/issues/11).

We're hoping that will enable others to help us improve things here!

## Goals and anti-goals

We're not trying to document our existing P-leveing system here.  We're only
trying to identify and organize types of engineering contributions.

We're attempting to organize contributions based on what we've historically observed to be impactful at various P-levels.

The immediate goal is to spark conversations about what we should keep and what we should change.

Over time, we aim to enable engineers to understand and influence the factors
used in determining their P-level.


## Terminology

#### *Contribution* / *Skill*
- What: A specific, observable statement describing how an engineer may positively impact their team.  A single engineer doesn't have to master _all_ of these skills/contributions to be successful at Pivotal.

- Example: *"Understands and explains the importance of improving feedback loops"*

- Materializes as: A "bullet-point" in a markdown file in this repo, and a "row" in our feedback forms.

#### *Skill Level*
- What: Contributions at a Skill Level are what we typically observe of Pivots at that P-Level

- Example: "P3"

- Materializes as: A column in the markdown files here.  Also, Contributions/Skills in the feedback form are ordered roughly according to this number.


#### *Skill Area*
- What: A course-grained area of impact. Contains a set of possible contributions, organized by Skill Level.  A single engineer doesn't have to master _all_ of these areas to be successful at Pivotal.

- Example: *"Technical Execution"*

- Materializes as: A markdown file in this repo, or a pair pages in our feedback forms.


#### *Impact Heatmap*

- What: A visual summary of feedback gathered for a single Pivot, organized by Skill Area (rows) and level-of-impact (columns).  It is used by managers to guide the growth of their reports and is **one of** the inputs used when determining a Pivot's P-level.

- Materializes as: A google sheet owned by a manager.



## Writing style
- Phrase skills in a "Does X" style, whenever possible.
- Frequency is currently handled via the feedback form, so it doesn't need to be part of the skill definitions.
- Focus on the **impact** of contributions, rather than simply the mechanics of doing them. We want these skills to be useful incentives as well as measures of success.
  - üëç "Can fit healthy engineering chores into the normal flow of feature development." Pivots can be incentivized to maintain team health and balance with execution.
  - üëé "Refactors code regularly" Pivots might be incentivized to refactor code, simply to check this box.

## Themes across levels

These themes span skills and skill areas, and are ordered from left-to-right
roughly in terms of scope or depth of impact.  They can be useful in determining what
P-level a particular skill belongs at.

##### Taking initiative
Following ‚Üí Ability ‚Üí Initiative ‚Üí Follow-through

##### Operating in the unknown
Doing well-defined tasks ‚Üí Doing less-defined tasks ‚Üí Leading others through areas of uncertainty

##### Mechanics
Assisting others in doing X ‚Üí Doing X ‚Üí Doing X exceptionally ‚Üí Coaching others on doing X

##### Consistency
When asked  ‚Üí Reacting to own observations ‚Üí Proactively ‚Üí Continually

##### Scope of impact
Themselves ‚Üí Their pair ‚Üí Their team ‚Üí Surrounding / similar teams ‚Üí The organization

##### Presence
Respectful ‚Üí Inclusive ‚Üí Empathetic
